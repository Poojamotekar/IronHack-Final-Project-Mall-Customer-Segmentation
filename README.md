# Problem Statement
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.
To make predictions and find the clusters of potential customers of the mall and thus find appropriate measures to increase the revenue of the mall is one of the prevailing applications of unsupervised learning. 
For example, a group of customers have high income but their spending score (amount spent in the mall) is low so from the analysis we can convert such type of customers into potential customers (whose spending score is high) by using strategies like better advertising, accepting feedback and improving the quality of products.
To identify such customers, this project analyses and forms clusters based on different criteria which are discussed in the further sections. 

# ABOUT THE DATA 
This dataset contains basic information about mall customers, such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income (k$), and spending score (1â€“100)
A spending score is a score assigned to each customer based on their spending behavior. 
Annual income is the annual income of the customer, typically measured in thousands of dollars (k).
# The Approach 
  Performing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
  Using KMEANS Clustering and DBSCAN Algorithm to create our segments.
  Using Summary Statistics on the clusters.
